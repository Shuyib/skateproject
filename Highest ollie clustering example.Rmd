## Skate-aid Worldwide Highest Ollie Contest 2017
On 7th January 2017, [Skate-aid](http://www.skate-aid.org) organised a competition which involved the contestant(s). Jumping over an adjustable obstacle by Ollieing especially where they have established projects namely: 

* Copenhagen, Denmark (DK)
* Cape Town, South Africa (ZA)
* Münster, Germany (DE)
* Nairobi, Kenya (KE)
* San Isidro, Costa Rica (CR)
* Dodoma, Tanzania (TZ)
* Bethlehem, Palestine (PS)
* Kigali, Rwanda (RW)
* Kampala,Uganda (UG)
* La Paz,Bolivia (BO)

Additionally, the rules to govern the event worldwide can be found here [rules](https://etrigg.com/event/skate-aid-worldwide-highest-ollie-contest-2017/49489654/). Here's a skater from Kenya jumping over the obstacle. Which is an adjustible wood plank in this case.

'The aim of the contest was to unite skaters from all over the world and to help at-risk youths with a safe and constructive space that children require in their developmental ages.' [From page Skate-aid Shangilia Skatepark Nairobi - Kenya

From the results of the competition. Which i acquired using this link [results](https://www.facebook.com/skateaid/posts/1379140678786498). Here are the results.

1. Copenhagen: Alexander Risrad - 103 cm (highest record)

2. Cape Town: Ryan Naidoo -99 cm 

3. Münster: Georg G Anders -85 cm

4. Nairobi: Kevin Maina - 75 cm 

5. San Isidro: William Morales -70 cm

6. Dodoma: Gideon -54cm 

7. Bethlehem: Moyyed and Anas- 20 cm (Under 15 only)

8. Kigali: 15cm (under 15 only)

9. Uganda: from John Ray's post here [facebook post](https://www.facebook.com/search/top/?init=quick&q=highest%20ollie%20uganda&tas=0.20332534655961598)

cm- Centimeters in height.

I changed the results a bit so that they could be accomodated in the graph i've drawn below. Notice the changes in the lines of code below.

## Making the dataframe

```{r df}
# making a dataframe of the results of the contest 
ctry <- c('DK','ZA','DE','KE','CR','TZ','UG','PS','RW','US') #different countries
hts <- c(103,99,85,75,70,54,88.4,20,15,114.3) # heights are in centimetres
names <- c('A.Risrad(103)','R.Naidoo(99)','G.Anders(85)','K.Maina(75)','W.Morales(70)','Gideon(54)','Peter(88.4)','Moyyed & Anas(20)','Na.RW(15)','A.Garcia(114.3)')
df <- data.frame(ctry,hts,names)
df
```

## Drawing the plot(dendogram)

```{r}
# Make hierarichal clustering object and visualize
dist_mat <- dist(df[,2]) # selecting the second column
hc <- hclust(dist_mat)
plot(hc, labels = df$names, xlab = "Different heights of individuals in different countries", main = "How close the Ollie Heights were between countries \n
     Skate-aid International Annual Ollie Contest 2017")
legend(x = "bottomright", legend = "Close heights are paired in the leaves.")
```

## Interpretation

The graph you've seen above puts the Ollie heights together with the ones most closest being in the same leaf. That is, **Moyyes & Anas** and **Na.RW** (i named it like that because the name of the person was missing and i didn't find it anywhere). In addition, the heights of **A.Risrad** and **R.Naidoo** are really close to each other. Notice i also added the [Guinness world record](http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/skateboarding-highest-ollie-) as well for comparison. 

## Conclusion

**A.Garcia** still holds the world record from Las Vegas, United States in 2011. But, if more practice & learning from mistakes could be used by **A.Risrad** and **R.Naidoo** the record could be beat as an example. Now, you know whose Ollie height was close to whom. Question is, where would yours be among these heights? Thanks for reading!
